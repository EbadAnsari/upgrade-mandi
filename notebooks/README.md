# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks organized by analysis workflow stage.

## Directory Structure

### `01-data-collection/`
Notebooks for data collection and initial exploration:
- `Blink It.ipynb` - Data collection from Blink It platform
- `Swiggy & Zepto Collection.ipynb` - Data collection from Swiggy and Zepto

### `02-preprocessing/`
Notebooks for data cleaning and preprocessing:
- `Swiggy & Zepto Preprocessing.ipynb` - Data cleaning and transformation

### `03-analysis/`
Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and modeling:
- *Add your analysis notebooks here*

### `04-reporting/`
Notebooks for generating reports and visualizations:
- `Raw to Report.ipynb` - Report generation from raw data
- `notion-to-power-bi.ipynb` - Integration with Power BI dashboards

## Naming Convention

Use the format: `##-descriptive-name.ipynb` where ## is the sequence number within each directory.

Examples:
- `01-swiggy-data-collection.ipynb`
- `02-data-quality-check.ipynb`
- `03-exploratory-analysis.ipynb`

## Best Practices

1. **Clear documentation** - Add markdown cells explaining each step
2. **Reproducible code** - Use relative paths and config files
3. **Version control** - Commit notebooks with cleared outputs
4. **Modular design** - Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks
